Skin Cancer Classification using VGG16 and Transfer Learning

This project leverages the pre-trained VGG16 model with transfer learning to classify skin cancer images into multiple categories. It utilizes data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques to improve model performance.

Overview

The project focuses on using the VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, to classify images from the ISIC Skin Cancer dataset into 9 different classes. By freezing the convolutional layers of the VGG16 model, a custom classification head is added to train on the skin cancer dataset. The project involves:

Data Augmentation for generating diverse training examples.
Transfer Learning to use pre-trained knowledge from VGG16.
Fine-tuning to further improve model accuracy by unfreezing the base model.
Dataset

The dataset used is from the Skin Cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration project, containing a variety of skin cancer types. It is split into training and validation subsets.

Training Set: Augmented to improve generalization.
Validation Set: Used for evaluating model performance.
Model Architecture

Base Model: VGG16 without the top layers.
Custom Layers: A flattened layer followed by a dense layer of 256 neurons and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification.
Training: Initially, the VGG16 layers are frozen and only the custom layers are trained. Later, the full model is fine-tuned.
Key Components

Transfer Learning: Pre-trained VGG16 model is used to extract features.
Custom Dense Layers: Added on top of the frozen VGG16 model for skin cancer classification.
Data Augmentation: Applied to the training data using transformations like rotation, zooming, shifting, and flipping.
Fine-tuning: After initial training, the full VGG16 model is unfrozen and fine-tuned for better performance.
Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following packages installed:

TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Access to Google Colab (recommended for GPU usage)
Code Structure

Data Preprocessing: The images are resized to 224x224 pixels and augmented using rotation, zoom, width/height shifts, and flips.
Model Setup: VGG16 is loaded with pre-trained ImageNet weights. A custom classifier is added and compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.
Training: The model is first trained with the frozen base layers, and then fine-tuned after unfreezing VGG16's layers.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the validation set, and test accuracy is reported.
Visualization: Sample augmented images are visualized to demonstrate the augmentation techniques.
How to Run

Clone the repository and upload the dataset to the specified folder structure.
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script in Google Colab (with GPU enabled).
Train the model and observe the accuracy and loss metrics during training.
Results

After training the model for 10 epochs, fine-tuning is performed for another 10 epochs. The final test accuracy is reported after evaluating the model on the test set.

Output

A trained model is saved as vgg16_skin_cancer_model.h5 for later use.
Future Improvements

Experiment with different architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
Add hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Apply more advanced data augmentation techniques.
